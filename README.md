# Thesis metrics

This repository is to dump all metrics I've collected while writing my undergraduate thesis.
They are all related to the [Convideo](https://github.com/lucasecdb/convideo) app.

## Filename meaning

We follow some structure in the file names, and they mean the following:

- Starting with `it_` means that the metrics collected inside the file were collected
  in _individual tabs_, hence the "it".

- Starting with `st_`, with the same logic as the previous one, means they were collected
  in the _same tab_.

If the file ends with `ffmpeg`, means we used the FFMPEG version of the script when collecting
the metrics, else, if it ends in `transcoding`, it means we used the adapted transcoding example
from the FFMPEG docs.
